Seminar Evaluation

Seminar on Social Media Content Analysis


The attendants of the seminar must write a brief report in English (around 10 pages, excluding figures and references), 
individually or (preferably) in groups of two people, on the following topic.

During this week we have explored in the seminar different ways of analysing the textual content (and the meta-data) 
of a set of tweets to address issues such as the semantic annotation of different kinds of entities 
(people, locations, organisations), the automatic discovery of the main topics of discussion, the analysis 
of spatio-temporal information, the obtention of health-related knowledge and the analysis of the polarity 
of the opinions on a given topic.

Your task is to complete the following two activities:

* Think about 3 data sets of tweets that you could obtain by using for example the Twitter API. 
You can assume that you can retrieve tweets using filtering criteria such as the language of the tweet, 
the senders of the tweet, a particular string (word, hashtag, mention, URL) present in the tweet, the 
location from which the tweet was sent or the time in which the tweet was sent. These data sets must be 
clearly different from the ones used as examples during the seminar. They must also be substantially 
different among themselves, so that you can cover many diverse situations; for example, you can think 
about the following dimensions of analysis:

- Small set of tweets (thousands) vs large set of tweets (millions).

- Fixed set of tweets vs constant streaming of tweets.

- Domain-specific tweets vs generic tweets.

- Location-related tweets vs worldwide tweets.

- Uni-language vs multi-language data sets.

* For each of these data sets, think about the possibility of applying the different analytic techniques 
and tools discussed in the seminar. For each applicable method, explain, at least, the following aspects:

- Why it could be interesting/appropriate to apply the method/tool to that data set.

- Which would be the main problems to be faced in the analysis of the data.

- Which would be the more interesting results that could be obtained, and how they could be presented to the users.

- Which would be the kinds of users more interested on those results.

Note that you are not requested to make a summary of the content of the seminar, but rather to think about 
how different methodologies could be applied in different specific circumstances to discover interesting 
knowledge. It is not necessary to implement anything; however, it will be very positively considered if 
you can actually retrieve one of the data sets you have defined, apply one of the methods/tools seen in 
the seminar and show some results (in this case you can extend the 10-pages length as necessary).

The reports must be sent, as a PDF file, to antonio.moreno@urv.cat, not later than June 12th, 2016. 
This deadline can not be further extended. Similar reports from different groups will not be accepted.
