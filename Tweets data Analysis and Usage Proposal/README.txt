NOTES
=====

DATA FILES:
-----------
	The files atached in the data folder show the full execution 
	process of the experiment performed for the Castellers dataset.

SOURCE CODE FILES:
------------------
	The code files are numbered in the oder that should be executed
	in order to obtain the final resuls, however, notice that due
	to some issues with the Twitter API, it was impossible to 
	build a unique code that did everything, since some of them,
	in fact, must be executed several times, before finishing with
	all the requiered queries.
	Notice that in this case, there is a counter in the code, that
	must be changed with the last number printed in the previous 
	execution.
